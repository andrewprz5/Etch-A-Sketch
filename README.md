# Etch-A-Sketch

This project is an etch-a-sketch program that allows the user to draw whatever they like on a grid of square divs. To "draw" on a square is to use a hover effect that will change color when the mouse passes over it. User can choose how many squares they would like in their grid to make their drawing more "pixelated", but the maximum limit is 100. This project is built using Javascript DOM manipulation skills, CSS styling, and HTML.
